- The formatting of this section should follow the formatting of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), although you can look at previous entries to get an idea.

### Pull Request

- The PR Title should start with `(MAJOR)`, `(MINOR)` or, `(PATCH)` to mark their severity according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
