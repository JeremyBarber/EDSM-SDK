# EDSM SDK

## What Is This?

Welcome CMDR! This is an attempt to construct a full C# SDK for EDSM.net. Why am I doing this now, for an 8 year old game? Good question. Not entirely sure. But I wanted to build a few tools that use EDSM as daata source so I'll find this useful even if nobody else does!

## [Releases](https://github.com/JeremyBarber/EDSM-SDK/releases)

The package is available throguh nuget.org
